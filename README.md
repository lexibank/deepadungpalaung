## Notes

## Changes in the transcription system 

The transcription system required some changes. Some letters were wrongly chosen from IPA standards, and I decided to count all spaces as indicators of morpheme boundaries, thus adding a "+" character, rather than representing them as two words. This only applies to the segmented transcription and alignments, as the original data has been preserved.

Few words had two entries. Cognate indication, however, obviously only referred to the first entry. I kept the entries in the original value, but retained only the first entry in the segmented form.

Few cognates were doubtful (of the formula "1 or 2"). I retained the first one, and discarded the second.
